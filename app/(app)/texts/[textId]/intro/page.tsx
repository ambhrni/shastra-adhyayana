        heading: 'Why Study the Vādāvalī?',
        body: 'The Vādāvalī is one of the finest specimens of Sanskrit philosophical reasoning in the entire Indian tradition. It is a masterclass in navya-nyāya applied to Vedānta — every argument is structured with the full precision of Indian logic: pakṣa (thesis), hetu (reason), dṛṣṭānta (example), and dūṣaṇa (refutation). Reading it trains the philosophical mind in a way few texts can.\n\nMore than that, the Vādāvalī addresses questions that are among the deepest in all of philosophy, East or West: Is the world real? Is consciousness one or many? What is ignorance? Can the very concept of illusion be coherently stated? Jayatīrtha pursues these with a rigor and elegance that rewards careful study at every level — from the first-time reader encountering Indian philosophy to the advanced scholar.',
      },
      {
        heading: 'What is Madhva Tattvavāda Siddhānta?',
        body: 'Vedānta is the philosophical tradition that interprets the three foundational texts of Indian philosophy — the Upaniṣads, the Brahmasūtras, and the Bhagavadgītā. Different schools interpret these texts differently.\n\nMadhvācārya (1238–1317 CE) founded the Tattvavāda school — the philosophy of reality as it truly is. His central insight is that difference (bheda) is real, irreducible, and eternal. There are five fundamental differences: between the Lord (Viṣṇu/Brahman) and individual souls (jīvas), between the Lord and matter (jaḍa), between soul and matter, between different souls, and between different material objects.\n\nThis stands in sharp contrast to Advaita Vedānta, associated with Śaṅkarācārya, which holds that the multiplicity of the world is ultimately illusory (māyā) and that only Brahman — undifferentiated pure consciousness — truly exists. The Vādāvalī is a sustained and rigorous refutation of Advaita\'s key positions from within the Tattvavāda framework.',
      },
      {
        heading: 'What is the Vādāvalī?',
        body: 'The Vādāvalī — meaning \'a garland of arguments\' — is a concise Sanskrit philosophical treatise by Jayatīrtha (14th century CE), the greatest logician and systematizer of the Tattvavāda tradition. Revered as Ṭīkācārya (the master commentator), Jayatīrtha was the direct intellectual successor to Madhvācārya. The Vādāvalī demonstrates with full logical force that the Advaita account of the world as illusion is philosophically untenable.',
      },
      {
        heading: 'The Two Commentaries',
        body: 'The Vādāvalī is studied here alongside two authoritative commentaries:\n\n**Bhāvadīpikā** by Rāghavendra Tīrtha (1595–1671 CE) — One of the greatest scholar-saints of the Tattvavāda tradition, Rāghavendra Tīrtha\'s commentary illuminates every argument with philosophical depth and precision, grounding each claim in authoritative sources.\n\n**Vādāvalīprakāśaḥ** by Śrīnivāsa Tīrtha — A scholarly commentary that expands on difficult passages and engages deeply with navya-nyāya, making the logical structure of Jayatīrtha\'s arguments accessible to the careful student.',

        heading: 'A Section-by-Section Overview',
        body: 'The Vādāvalī proceeds in 40 sections through a systematic dismantling of the Advaita account of mithyātva (the illusoriness of the world) and an establishment of the Tattvavāda position that the world is genuinely real and difference is irreducible. The summaries below are based exclusively on Rāghavendra Tīrtha\'s Bhāvadīpikā.',

      { label: '§1 — Maṅgalaślokaḥ', summary: 'Rāghavendra Tīrtha opens his Bhāvadīpikā with his own maṅgala verse saluting Viṣṇu, then announces his intention to expound the Vādāvalī \'to the best of his understanding, for the delight of the learned,\' after saluting his guru-lineage headed by Ānandatīrtha (Madhva). He gives the philosophical rationale for Jayatīrtha\'s entire work: the Brahmasūtra\'s first aphorism presupposes Brahman\'s infinite auspicious qualities, and the second sūtra characterizes Brahman as the real cause of the world — which holds only if the world is genuinely real. Therefore the entire Vādāvalī is composed in defense of jagatsatya (the world\'s reality) by refuting the Māyāvādin\'s alleged proofs of world-falsity.' },
      { label: '§2 — Mithyātvasādakānumānabhaṅgaḥ', summary: 'The Māyāvādin challenges world-reality by citing Ānandabodha\'s inference: \'the debated object is false, because it is perceptible, inert, and finite, like shell-silver.\' Rāghavendra explains how Jayatīrtha\'s response \'not so, because mithyātva cannot be defined\' attacks the very sādhya (property to be proved). Seven alternative definitions of mithyātva are listed — each will be shown unworkable in the sections that follow.' },
      { label: '§3 — Anirvacanīyatvabhaṅgaḥ', summary: 'The longest and technically most dense section. The Advaitin\'s primary characterization — mithyātva as anirvacanīyatva (inexpressibility: being expressible as neither real nor unreal) — is subjected to exhaustive logical examination. Two readings of \'anirvacanīya\' are explored and both are self-defeating. The mutual exhaustion argument is established: sat and asat are mutually exhaustive — both cannot simultaneously be absent from any locus. Every specification of ātmatva as the ground of reality is demolished. Citsukhācārya\'s inference for anirvacanīyatva is refuted on grounds of pratijñāvirodha, vyabhicāra, and sopādhikatva.' },
      { label: '§4 — Avidyālakṣaṇanirāsaḥ', summary: 'The arthāpatti underlying anirvacanīyatva rests on \'sacchenna bādhyeta\' — so Rāghavendra examines what \'sat\' means here. Three alternatives are proposed and each fails: sat as sattājātiyukta violates the vyāpti since sattā-bearing anātman is admitted to be sublatable; sat as abādhya is circular; sat as brahmasvarūpa is siddhasādhana. Similarly the \'asat\' limb is examined and shown self-defeating from multiple angles.' },
      { label: '§5 — Avidyāpramāṇanirāsaḥ', summary: 'Having demolished avidyā\'s definition, the text attacks its alleged pramāṇas. Perception cannot establish avidyā — its inexpressibility places it beyond any determinate perceptual grasp. Inference cannot establish it — any vyāpti relating the marks of avidyā to its nature is circular. Scripture does not establish it — śruti texts like \'satyaṃ khalvidaṃ brahma\' affirm jagatsatya. Arthāpatti fails — already shown in §4.' },
      { label: '§6 — Mithyātvaniruktirasopasaṃhāraḥ', summary: 'A summary consolidation: all seven definitions of mithyātva are unworkable and no pramāṇa can establish it. Since mithyātva cannot be coherently defined, the Advaita inference suffers from aprasiddha-viśeṣaṇa in the sādhya — the inferential charge fails at the level of the conclusion itself.' },
      { label: '§7 — Dṛśyatvavikalpa nirāsaḥ', summary: 'The refutation of hetu begins. Dṛśyatva (perceptibility) as the reason for mithyātva is examined in every specification — dṛg-vṛtti-viṣayatva, jñātatā, vyavahāra-rūpa-phala — either Brahman itself falls under the hetu or the hetu fails to reach the entire pakṣa.' },
      { label: '§8 — Dṛśyatvahetu nirāsaḥ', summary: 'Further examination of dṛśyatva: if sākṣi-viṣayatva, the sākṣī itself becomes dṛśya and hence mithyā — an unacceptable consequence. If indriya-janita-vṛtti-viṣayatva, Brahman known through vedānta-janita-vṛtti falls under the same mark — vyabhicāra.' },
      { label: '§9 — Jaḍatvahetu nirāsaḥ', summary: 'Jaḍatva (inertness) as the second hetu is examined. Three definitions are proposed — jñānaśūnyatva, ātmatva-anādhāratva, and ātmākāra-vṛtty-anāśrayatva — each either forces Brahman itself to be jaḍa or generates ātmāśraya, making the vyāpti \'jaḍa things are mithyā\' invalid.' },
      { label: '§10 — Paricchinnatvahetu nirāsaḥ', summary: 'Parichinnatva (finitude) as the third hetu. Proposed definitions — avacchinnatva, deśādiparicchinnatva — fail because ākāśa and kāla are admitted real yet finite in some sense, giving vyabhicāra. The hetu cannot be established without collateral damage to admitted reals.' },
      { label: '§11 — Mithyātvānumānasya pratyakṣabādhaḥ', summary: 'The mithyātva inference is directly contradicted by perception. The world is perceived as real — \'the pot exists,\' \'the cloth is here\' — these perceptions carry no internal mark of unreality. No sublating cognition of the form \'this is not real\' arises in ordinary experience. Direct perceptual evidence establishes jagatsatya and bādhes the inference.' },
      { label: '§12 — Mithyātvānumānasya śrutiviroddhaḥ', summary: 'The inference is contradicted by Vedic testimony. Key śruti passages — \'satyaṃ khalvidaṃ brahma,\' \'sarvaṃ khalvidaṃ brahma\' — affirm the reality of this world, not its illusoriness. Rāghavendra shows that Advaita misreads the \'unity\' texts as negating the world\'s reality, when they actually affirm Brahman as the real ground of a real world.' },
      { label: '§13 — Mithyātvānumānasya smṛtiviroddhaḥ', summary: 'The inference is contradicted by smṛti — the Bhagavadgītā and allied texts consistently affirm the reality of God, souls, and world as distinct entities. The Gītā\'s practical teaching of karma, jñāna, and bhakti presupposes real distinctions between agent, knowledge, and the Lord. An illusory world cannot ground genuine practice.' },
      { label: '§14 — Mithyātvānumānasya anumānaviroddhaḥ', summary: 'The inference is contradicted by independent inference. The world\'s reality can itself be inferred: Brahman is the real cause of a real effect — a non-existent effect cannot have a real cause. The causal relation presupposes the reality of both relata.' },
      { label: '§15 — Mithyātva hetu ekaliṃganirūpaṇam', summary: 'The logical mark (liṅga) used in the Advaita inference is a kevalānvayin mark (universally present), which means vyabhicāra cannot be established for it through negative instances. This vitiates the inference — the hetu cannot do the epistemological work required of it.' },
      { label: '§16 — Satayvahetu pratikūlatarkoddāraḥ', summary: 'The arguments for mithyātva are shown to be counterproductive — each reason proposed can equally serve as a reason for the opposite conclusion, jagatsatya. The logic of the Advaita inference turns against itself.' },
      { label: '§17 — Dṛśyatvādihetutrayabhaṅgaḥ', summary: 'A comprehensive refutation of all three hetus — dṛśyatva, jaḍatva, parichinnatva — taken together. Each singly and all together fail to establish mithyātva as a coherent sādhya.' },
      { label: '§18 — Aṃśatānumānasya bādhaḥ', summary: 'The Advaitin\'s inference from partial cognition (aṃśatā) — that the cognition of a part implies the unreality of the whole — is directly contradicted by cases where partial cognition is of real objects.' },
      { label: '§19 — Aṃśatānumānanirāsaḥ', summary: 'A complete logical refutation of the aṃśatā inference — the hetu is unestablished in the pakṣa and the vyāpti fails under examination.' },
      { label: '§20 — Mithyātvahetu aprayojakatam', summary: 'The definitive result: all proposed reasons for mithyātva are non-probative (aprayojaka). None establish the sādhya; each either collapses into vyabhicāra, sopādhikatva, or generates unacceptable consequences for the Advaitin\'s own admitted truths.' },
      { label: '§21 — Satyavahetu pratikūlatarkoddāraḥ', summary: 'The positive counterpart: the same logical structures proposed as reasons for mithyātva serve equally — or better — as reasons for jagatsatya. The inference for world-reality is logically stronger than any inference for world-falsity.' },
      { label: '§22 — Neha nānāsti śrutyarthavicāraḥ', summary: 'The Upaniṣadic passage \'neha nānāsti kiñcana\' (Bṛhadāraṇyaka 4.4.19) is examined. Rāghavendra shows it affirms that there is no multiplicity independent of Brahman — it does not deny that the world, grounded in Brahman, is real. The passage concerns the nature of dependence, not the unreality of the dependent.' },
      { label: '§23 — Ekameveti śrutyarthavicāraḥ', summary: '\'Ekamevādvitīyam\' (Chāndogya 6.2.1) is examined. Rāghavendra shows \'advitīya\' means Brahman has no equal or superior — it does not mean multiplicity is unreal. The passage speaks to Brahman\'s absolute supremacy, not to monism of being.' },
      { label: '§24 — Satyaṃ jñānam iti śrutyarthaḥ', summary: '\'Satyaṃ jñānam anantaṃ brahma\' (Taittirīya 2.1) — \'satyam\' means that which is not sublated in any of the three times; \'jñānam\' means self-luminous; \'anantam\' means unlimited by space, time, or entity. Rāghavendra shows this passage describes Brahman\'s nature as the real ground of the world, not a denial of the world\'s reality.' },
      { label: '§25 — Viśvasatyatva pratipādanopasaṃhāraḥ', summary: 'The first great movement of the Vādāvalī concludes: by perception, scripture, smṛti, and inference, jagatsatya is established. All Māyāvādin pramāṇas are shown to be ābhāsas (apparent, not genuine). Viṣṇu\'s world-creatorship is real. Rāghavendra summarizes with crisp finality.' },
      { label: '§26 — Bhedabādhakayā pratīyamānayuktinirāsaḥ', summary: 'The second movement begins: bheda (difference) must now be established as real. The Advaitin claims bheda is itself sublated — but what sublates it? Neither perception nor scripture bādhes bheda. The alleged sublating evidence is itself unfounded.' },
      { label: '§27 — Bhedamithyātvānumāne asiddhikathanam', summary: 'The Advaitin\'s inference \'bheda is mithyā\' suffers from asiddhi — the hetu is not established in the pakṣa. Whatever is proposed as the reason for bheda\'s falsity is itself either a form of bheda or an unestablished entity.' },
      { label: '§28 — Bhedamithyātvānumānasya sopādhikatvam', summary: 'The inference is shown to be sopādhika — it operates only under a vitiating condition. The proposed hetu (apramāṇagamyatva) is present only in prātibhāsika objects, not in bheda which is directly and veridically perceived.' },
      { label: '§29 — Bhedasya pratyakṣādyagrāhyatva pūrvapakṣaḥ', summary: 'The Advaitin\'s objections to bheda-pratyakṣa are presented in full as pūrvapakṣa: if bheda is known independently it requires prior knowledge of its terms; if known simultaneously with its terms the causal sequence is violated; if bheda itself has bheda an infinite regress results. Rāghavendra presents these objections with full rigor before answering them.' },
      { label: '§30 — Bhedasya dharmisvaro patvāsamarthanam', summary: 'The central thesis of the second movement: bheda is the svarūpa (very nature) of the dharmin, not an additional property. Hence the cognition of the dharmin and the cognition of its bheda are one unified act — no causal sequence, no mutual dependence, no regress. This single insight dissolves all the objections of §29.' },
      { label: '§31 — Kālādeḥ sākṣisiddhatva samarthanam', summary: 'Kāla (time), dik (direction), ākāśa (space), and ātman are established as known directly by the sākṣī (witness-consciousness). Bheda too is sākṣī-known: \'this pot differs from that cloth\' is immediate sākṣī-experience. Therefore bheda is real.' },
      { label: '§32 — Sākṣisamarthanam', summary: 'The sākṣī is defended as a genuine epistemological entity. The Advaitin uses the sākṣī to establish avidyā yet denies it reveals bheda. Rāghavendra shows this is inconsistent: if the sākṣī can reveal modifications of avidyā it can equally reveal bheda, which is equally immediate. To selectively deny the sākṣī\'s validity for bheda-experience is arbitrary.' },
      { label: '§33 — Prāmāṇyasya svatastvāsamarthanam', summary: 'Valid knowledge is self-validating (svataḥprāmāṇya): no cognition requires a further cognition to certify its validity. The Advaitin claims bheda-perception is bhrānti — but establishing any cognition as bhrānti requires a bādhaka pramāṇa. No bādhaka for bheda-pratyakṣa exists. In its absence, the bheda-cognition stands valid by svataḥprāmāṇya.' },
      { label: '§34 — Kālasya sākṣivedyatva samarthanopasaṃhāraḥ', summary: 'Kāla\'s sākṣī-vedyatva is confirmed and consolidated. Since kāla is real and sākṣī-vedya, and bheda is equally sākṣī-vedya by parallel reasoning, bheda is real. This section closes the sākṣī argument.' },
      { label: '§35 — Bhedapratyakṣasya anyonyāśrayādyuddhāraḥ', summary: 'The anyonyāśraya objection is formally answered: dharmin and pratiyogī are not cognized as featureless substrates prior to bheda-cognition. From the very first moment the cognitive act grasps \'this pot, distinct from that cloth.\' The cognition of the object and its bheda are one act — no mutual dependence.' },
      { label: '§36 — Dharmi-pratiyogi bhedapratyayānāṃ yaugapadyasamarthanam', summary: 'The causal-sequencing objection is answered: since bheda is the dharmin\'s svarūpa, the cognitions of dharmin, pratiyogī, and their bheda constitute one unified cognitive act. Simultaneity is not a violation of causal logic but an expression of the unitary structure of bheda-cognition.' },
      { label: '§37 — Viśeṣasamarthanam', summary: 'Ultimate differentiators (viśeṣas) in Vaiśeṣika ontology explain the distinctness of eternal, partless entities. Rāghavendra supports this: viśeṣas are dharmi-svarūpa for eternal entities, directly known through the cognition of those entities, and are self-differentiating — the regress stops here. Even among eternal entities, real bheda is coherently grounded.' },
      { label: '§38 — Bhedapratītyākṣepa nirāsopasaṃhāraḥ', summary: 'All objections to bheda-pratyakṣa — anyonyāśraya, causal-sequencing impossibility, viśeṣa incoherence, infinite regress — have been answered. Bheda-pratyakṣa is established as a legitimate, defect-free, self-valid pramāṇa.' },
      { label: '§39 — Bhedamithyātvānumānasya pratijñāvirodhaḥ', summary: 'The inference \'bheda is mithyā\' is self-defeating. If all bheda is mithyā, the distinction between \'mithyā\' and \'satya\' — which the Advaitin must make in formulating this very conclusion — is itself a bheda and hence mithyā. The entire inferential process relies on bheda at every step — an inference that concludes \'all bheda is false\' defeats itself.' },
      { label: '§40 — Bhedamithyātvānumānasya vyabhicārādikathanam', summary: 'The final and most comprehensive section surveys all logical defects of the bheda-mithyātva inference: asiddhi, anaikāntika/vyabhicāra, sopādhikatva, āśrayāsiddhi, pratijñāvirodha, and pratyakṣabādha. Each defect is argued with full nyāya-pramāṇa rigor. The Vādāvalī thus concludes: bheda is real, perceptible, self-validating, and constitutive of the nature of things. The Māyāvāda doctrine of world-falsity and difference-falsity has been defeated at every level.' },
